# Unity - City Scene

This project is the first Unity project I have ever developed. I designed a scene of a basic city highway. Although it is a small step, I experimented many tools of Unity. I learnt the basic features of Unity such as creating and modifying objects using Prefabs. I also wrote a basic Script that prints “Hello World!” to terminal.
